Requirements:

- pkg-config (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config)
	(not needed when compiling a release using the included isl)
- gmp (http://gmplib.org/)
- libyaml (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
	(only needed if you want to compile the pet executable)
- LLVM/clang libraries, 2.9 or higher (http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
	Unless you have some other reasons for wanting to use the svn version,
	it's best to install the latest release (9.0).
	The svn version occasionally introduces incompatibilities.
	Nevertheless, if you encounter any such incompatibilities, please
	report them so that they can be fixed.
	However, development versions from before the latest release
	are not supported.

	Also, if you are following the instructions on how to build
	from source, make sure you also install LLVM
	(through "make install").  You may want to specify an installation
	directory using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake option.
	You may also want to set the LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB option
	to enable the creation of a single shared library.

	If you configure older versions of LLVM using cmake, you may end up
	with clang libraries that have been compiled with -fno-rtti without
	this option appearing in the output of "llvm-config --cxxflags".
	You may then run into errors about undefined reference to the
	'typeinfo' of some classes.
	You will then have to add this option manually to CXXFLAGS while
	configuring pet.

	If you want to use the ubuntu package libclang-dev, then you need
	version 3.2 (ubuntu raring) or later.
	Older versions of this package did not include the required libraries.
	You may also need to install the llvm package for llvm-config.

Preparing:

Grab the latest release and extract it or get the source from
the git repository as follows.  This process requires autoconf,
automake, libtool and pkg-config.

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/pet.git
	cd pet
	./get_submodules.sh
	./autogen.sh

Compilation:

	./configure
	make
	make check

Use:

The main entry point is pet_scop_extract_from_C_source.
This function extracts a scop from the C source file with the given name
and returns it as a pet_scop.  The scop corresponds to the piece
of code delimited by

    #pragma scop

and

    #pragma endscop

The code in between needs to consist only of expression statements,
if statements and for statements.  All access relations and loop initializations
need to be piecewise quasi-affine.  Conditions are allowed to be non-affine,
in which case a separate statement is constructed to evaluate the condition.

If the autodetect option has been set, pet will try to automatically
detect a scop and no pragmas are required.  On the other hand, pet
will not produce any warnings in this case as any code that does not
satisfy the requirements is considered to lie outside of the scop.

The layout of pet_scop is documented in include/pet.h.
